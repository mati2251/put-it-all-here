# PUT it all here
My notes, code examples, and small projects that are too minor to have their own repositories, created during my first cycle of studies at Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology. Mainly for university purposes, but not always! :). 
I saved things that I thought would be useful in the future, or that I just liked.
Bigger projects is simple as git submodule.
Some of the stuff is just my own initiative to learn something new.
Most of the projects are described in a README.md file in their directories.
