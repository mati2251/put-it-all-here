# Male or female recognition by voice
## Introduction
Simple script to recognize male or female voice using harmonic product spectrum and detect laryngeal tone of voice.
## Harmonic product spectrum
Harmonic product spectrum is a method of fundamental frequency detection. It is based on the fact that the fundamental frequency of a signal is the lowest frequency component of the signal. The fundamental frequency is the greatest common divisor of the frequencies of all the harmonics. The harmonic product spectrum is calculated by multiplying the spectrum of the signal by its downsampled versions. The fundamental frequency is the frequency of the highest peak in the harmonic product spectrum.
